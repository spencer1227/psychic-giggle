# Social Network API

## My Task
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.
Your Challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## User Story
AS A social media startup
<br>
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
<br>
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API
<br>
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
<br>
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
<br>
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
<br>
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
<br>
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
<br>
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
<br>
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
<br>
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

## Mock Up
To start, I created routes and models pages for each the user and the thoughts. From there, I import the respective date into each folder's index file

## Technology Used
express
mongoose
Insomnia
MongoDB
